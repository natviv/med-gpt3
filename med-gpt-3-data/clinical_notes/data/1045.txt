<B>ANESTHESIA:</B>  General.

<B>INDICATIONS: </B> A 79-year-old woman with recurrent bladder tumors of the bladder neck.

<B>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  </B>The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in lithotomy position under satisfactory general anesthesia.  A #21-French cystourethroscope was inserted into the bladder.
